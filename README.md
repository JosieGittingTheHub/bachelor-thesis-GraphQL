# Example GraphQL Server and Client Implementation

The folder **miniSpotifyGraphQL** contains an example implementation of a Spotify GraphQL API, which realizes only a part of the operations possible in the real Spotify API.

The folder **moosicGraphQL** contains a React.js app that fetches data from the Spotify GraphQL API **minispotify**.

The folder **ss17-moosic** is a React.js app that has been developed during the [Mobile Web Applications](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/vorlesung_detail?vorlid=5212603) in summer semester 2017 at the [Hochschule f√ºr Medien](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/index_html) in Stuttgart. The folder is a git submodule and is a clone of the [original gitlab repository](https://gitlab.mi.hdm-stuttgart.de/mwa/ss17-moosic).
This app is fetching its data directly from the real Spotify REST API.

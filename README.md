The folder **minispotify** contains an example implementation of a Spotify GraphQL API, which only contains a part of the operations possible in the real Spotify API.

The folder **moosic** contains a React.js app that fetches data from the Spotify GraphQL API.

The folder **ss17-moosic** is a React.js app that has been developed during the [Mobile Web Applications](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/vorlesung_detail?vorlid=5212603) in summer semester 2017 at the [Hochschule f√ºr Medien](https://www.hdm-stuttgart.de/index_html) in Stuttgart. 
This app is fetching its data directly from the real Spotify REST API.
